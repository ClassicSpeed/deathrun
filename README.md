Deathrun Redux for TF2 https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=251489

A rewrite on the Oshizu's deathrun plugin.
I wanted a plugin that really restricts the weapons (I hate those people with the Ullapool caber/eureka/atomizer).
Also I love playing as any class without being in disadvantage!
